# Minecraft Server Marketplace Tracker

This is a quick project which pulls marketplace data from a Minecraft server's API to analyse what are the most profitable items to buy and sell based on factors such as profit margins, competition, and buy and sell volumes.

It also records historic prices of each item to be able to forecast trends.

All this will be hosted on a simple Streamlit website to display the data in Tables and Graphs
